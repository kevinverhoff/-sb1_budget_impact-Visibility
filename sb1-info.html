                    SB1 was passed by the Indiana Assembly in April 2025 and signed into law by Gov. Mike Braun. Most of the Republican representatives in the Assembly approved the bill, often without consulting with key stakeholders or constituents. SB1 claims to cut property taxes, but as property valuations go up, residents will not see lower tax bills. Instead of actually lowering taxes, SB1 simply shifts local property tax revenue, paid by local residents, out of local units of government. As a result, the state is requiring municipalities—schools, libraries, cities, counties, etc.—to make massive cuts. The Republican legislature has forced a crisis on Indiana municipalities. It is a crisis that forces local officials to make tough decisions that will not ultimately save taxpayers any money. It will mean more potholes, fewer police officers, longer response times by firefighters and EMS, decaying parks, and even less funding for local schools.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    While the stated intention of SB1 was to "control property taxes," the law has had the opposite effect. Instead of reducing taxes for Hoosier families, it has created a chaotic funding situation for local governments. Many cities and counties, including Greencastle, are being forced to make unprecedented budget cuts simply to comply with the state-mandated reductions. This shift in funding has left local leaders with no choice but to reduce essential services, impacting everything from public safety to infrastructure maintenance.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    The long-term consequences of SB1 are becoming increasingly clear. Without adequate funding, local governments will struggle to maintain basic services, leading to a decline in quality of life for residents. This legislation demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how property taxes and local governance work. It prioritizes political ideology over the needs of communities, leaving Indiana in a challenging position for years to come.
